# ping_pong_pygame
This is PING PONG, written using the pygame library :).
## Usage
To change the theme you need to write the shortened path to the file "config.pay". For example, if the full path is: "/home/user/ping_pong_pygame/theme/catppuccin/mocha/green/config.py", then you need to write: "catppuccin.mocha.green".
